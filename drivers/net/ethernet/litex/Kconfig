	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about LiteX devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_LITEX

config LITEX_LITEETH
	tristate "LiteX Ethernet support"
	select NET_CORE
	select MII
	select PHYLIB
	---help---
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for hardware with a LiteX LiteEth
	  device then you should answer Y to this.
